To add templates into vim and have it setup so that when you create a new file with an extesion it uses the template for the file:
you first need to create the templates and place them in a location.
Since I want them to be found by Vim, but not messed with on a general basis, I create a directory named .templates, with the period it is not seen in a general ls
I then create my template file in that directory, the .vimrc file in the home directory needs to be modified, if it doesn't exist cread it.
Add the following lines for the templates, this tells vim that if you create a file ending in .c to use template.c in the .templates directory, so on.
au BufNewFile *.c 0read ~/.templates/template.c
au BufNewFile *.cpp 0read ~/.templates/template.cpp
au BufNewFile *.php 0read ~/.templates/template.php

Next I like being able to put the DTS whenever I need to in my source.
The next two lines map F3 to inserting the DTS on that line at that point.
nmap <F3> a<C-R>=strftime("%Y-%m-%d %a %I:%M %p")<CR><Esc>
imap <F3> <C-R>=strftime("%Y-%m-%d %a %I:%M %p")<CR>

Also there is a plugin out there called timestamp, find it download it, and then just put it into a directory named .vim/plugin from your home directory and then run :EnableTimestamp from within Vim.

au BufWritePre *.html exe "norm mz"|exe '%s/\(<!-- DATE -->\).\{-\}\d\d:\d\d:\d\d/\1'.strftime("%b %d, %Y %X")."/e"|norm `z
